# Cricket-Score-Analysis---Batsman-Selection-Using-Python

Project Name: Cricket Score Analysis - Batsman Selection

This project delves into the analysis of cricket scores to aid in the selection of the most suitable batsman for England's cricketing conditions. The analysis encompasses various stages including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical comparisons between two batsmen, namely Batsman 1 and Batsman 2. Here's a summary of the key findings and insights:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Corrected erroneous data entry for Batsman 1's third match score and created a new feature 'weather' based on temperature conditions.

2. **Descriptive Statistics and Outlier Detection**: 
   - Computed descriptive statistics for both batsmen and identified potential outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Utilized box plots to visualize the scoring patterns of both batsmen and count plots to analyze the frequency of warm and cool weather conditions during matches.
   - Employed scatter plots to explore the relationship between batsmen scores and temperature.

4. **Skewness Analysis**: 
   - Examined the skewness of score distributions for both batsmen to understand the shape of the data distribution.

5. **Decision Making**: 
   - Based on comparisons of means, standard deviations, medians, and IQRs, as well as skewness values, Batsman 2 emerged as the preferred choice for England's cricket conditions.

6. **Conclusion**: 
   - Batsman 2 demonstrated superior statistics, including a higher mean, lower standard deviation, higher median, and smaller IQR, indicating more consistent and higher scores overall.

7. **Project Conclusion**: 
   - The analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of two batsmen and aids in the informed selection of Batsman 2 for optimal performance in England's cricketing climate.

This project encapsulates the process of data-driven decision-making in cricket team selection, leveraging statistical analysis and visualization techniques to derive actionable insights.
